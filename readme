What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?
This assignment was helpful in getting me more comfortable with coding
in this new type of environment. I will say though, the quiz we took
in class in 5 minutes felt like a poor representation of my understanding of the
assignment, as it didnt feel like enough time to think about the questions,
let alone solve them. Regardless though, I understand why they are in place.
